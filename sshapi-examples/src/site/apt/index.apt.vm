Examples

 SSHAPI is supplied with a number of examples to help get you started. The source for the examples
 is supplied with all distributions.
 
*Preparing the examples

 First off, you should {{{../sshapi-site/downloads.html}download}} the binary distribution, and extract it
 somewhere. The following example assumes you have downloaded the archive to your home directory, and will
 be installing it there also. 
 
**On Unix/Linux/OSX
 
+--
$ cd  
$ tar xzf sshapi-${applicationVersion}.tar.gz
+--

**On Windows

 Use you preferred tool to extract the Zip file to wherever your %HOME% directory is.
 
*Adding the providers

 Now you need your provider libraries. See the {{{../sshapi-site/links.html}links}} for where to
 obtain these. In our example, we will use <J2SSH>.  
 
**On Unix/Linux/OSX

 We will assume you have downloaded and extracted the J2SSH archive to your HOME directory (and so the Jars should be in <$HOME/j2ssh>)
 
+--
mkdir -p $HOME/.sshapi/providers
cp $HOME/j2ssh*.jar $HOME/sshapi-${applicationVersion}
+-- 

**On Windows

 We will assume you have downloaded and extracted the J2SSH archive to <C:\TEMP> directory (and so the Jars should be in <C:\TEMP\j2ssh>)

+--
MD %HOME%\.sshapi
MD %HOME%\.sshapi\providers
COPY C:\TEMP\j2ssh\j2ssh*.jar %HOME%\sshapi-${applicationVersion}
+-- 

*Running the examples
 
 Now run one of the example applications. 
 
 Note that because all of the SSHAPI jars contain the ClassPath MANIFEST.MF, 
 and they all exist in the same directory, you only need to add the examples
 jar itself. You do however have to add all jars for the provider.
 
 For other environments, e.g. running the examples from an IDE, you may have 
 to manually include the core, provider bridge and provider libraries yourself. 
 
**On Unix/Linux/OSX

+--
cd sshapi-${applicationVersion}
java -classpath sshapi-examples-${applicationVersion}.jar:j2ssh-core-0.2.9.jar:j2ssh-common-0.2.9.jar E01Shell
+-- 

**On Windows

+--
CD sshapi-${applicationVersion}
java -classpath sshapi-examples-${applicationVersion}.jar;j2ssh-core-0.2.9.jar;j2ssh-common-0.2.9.jar E01Shell
+--
