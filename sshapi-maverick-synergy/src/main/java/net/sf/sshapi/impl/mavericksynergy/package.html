	<p>Maverick Synergy is a Java implementation of the SSH2 protocol.
		It helps Java developers connect their Java applications to SSH
		servers to execute commands, transfer files, access remote network
		services, and much more.</p>
	<p>Synergy can also be used as an SSH server to allow other SSH
		clients to connect to your application. You can create your own
		Command Line Interface, develop commands in Java, and send and receive
		files on your custom file system.</p>
