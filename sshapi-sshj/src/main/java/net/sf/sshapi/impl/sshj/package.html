<p>JSch is a pure Java implementation of SSH2. JSch allows you to connect to an sshd server and
 use port forwarding, X11 forwarding, file transfer, etc., and you can integrate its functionality 
 into your own Java programs. JSch is licensed under BSD style license.</p>

<p>Downloads and more information about JSch may be found at <a href="http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/">http://www.jcraft.com/jsch/.</a></p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
	<li>JSch does not actually support separate connect / authenticate
	phases, so the connect() method does not actually connect to anything,
	and no exceptions will be thrown. The actual connection occurs during
	the authenticate() method.</li>
	<li>Again, because JSch does not actually support separate connect
	/ authenticate phases, an accurate value for getRemoteIdentification()
	will not be available until after authenticated.</li>
</ul>
