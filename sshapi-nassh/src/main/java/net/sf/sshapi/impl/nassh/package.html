<p>Ganymed SSH-2 for Java is a library which implements the SSH-2 protocol in pure Java (tested on J2SE 1.4.2 and 5.0). 
It allows one to connect to SSH servers from within Java programs. It supports SSH sessions (remote command execution 
and shell access), local and remote port forwarding, local stream forwarding, X11 forwarding, SCP and SFTP. There are 
no dependencies on any JCE provider, as all crypto functionality is included.</p>
<p>Originally, Ganymed SSH-2 for Java was developed for the Ganymed replication project at ETH Zurich (Switzerland).</p>
<p>Downloads and more information about JSch may be found at <a href="http://www.cleondris.ch/opensource/ssh2/">http://www.cleondris.ch/opensource/ssh2/</a>.</p>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Only allows access to the banner message <i>after</i>
	authentication, so the SshBannerHandler.banner() will be invoked then
	instead of before as with other providers.</li>
	<li>The remote server identification string is not available
	through the Ganymed API, so any called to
	SshClient.getRemoteIdentification() will result in the value <i>Unknown</i></li>
	<li>A number of operations rely on reflection, so you will require
	the appropriate permissions if a security manager is installed. This is
	due to Ganymed having information required by the API, but not exposing
	it through public members.</li>
</ul>
