<h1>SSHAPI</h1>

<p>SSHAPI serves as a simple facade or abstract for various SSH
client implementations (or providers as they are known in this API) such
as Maverick SSH or JSch.</p>

<p>It allows the user to plug in the required provider at deployment
time depending on their needs, for example because of specific
performance or licensing requirements.</p>

<p>SSHAPI will search the CLASSPATH for providers, and choose the 
best one for the requested configuration (or just a default). The 
behavior of the discovery can be configured using system properties</p>

<p>Specific providers can also be chosen manually at connection time. This
makes it possible to use different providers depending on configuration
of the connection, yet still use a single API for your application.</p>

<h2>Official Providers</h2>

<p>The SSHAPI project maintains a number of providers as sub-projects.
These providers will track the SSHAPI core and be released at the same
time.</p>

<p>* The provider implementation is licensed as BSD, but you will
require a commercial license for Maverick SSH itself</p>
